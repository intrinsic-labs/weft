# Designing a Modern Pseudocode Language and VS Code Integration

This document outlines the full concept and early-stage architectural planning of a robust pseudocode language and VS Code extension, aimed at serving as an intermediate representation between human-readable logic and real-world programming languages. The primary goal is to develop a pseudocode system powerful and structured enough to allow seamless translation to and from actual code, enabling LLM-assisted development and understanding. This would, if implemented properly, enable **much higher bandwidth per token** coding for developers, separating concerns of syntax and logical/creative flow in software engineering. 

## Overview

* **Goal:** Create a robust, structured pseudocode language that can:

  * Handle real-world edge cases (e.g., async/await, memory management, declarative UI)
  * Be translated to and from real code by LLMs without ambiguity
  * Support features like syntax highlighting, autocompletion, type inference, and error diagnostics
  * Be as fun (ideally even more fun) to develop with as your other favorite languages
* **Implementation Target:** VS Code (via custom extension and language server), other major IDEs (JetBrains, Zed, Sublime, etc)
* **Dev Stack Chosen:** TypeScript (possibly eventually rewrite in Rust for performance)

---

## Project Breakdown

### 1. **Language Capabilities**

The goal is to create the most flexible language in existence, versatile enough to support every edge case and cover the bases of every existing executable language. 

#### Key Features to Support:

* **Declarative UI** (inspired by React, SwiftUI, Jetpack Compose)
* **Asynchronous code patterns** (async/await, callbacks, promises)
* **Stateful logic** (state management primitives)
* **Memory and resource management** (abstracted but hint-able)
* **Database operations** (CRUD, transactions, schemas)
* **Strong type hinting** and **interfaces**
* **Custom modules and imports**
* **Pattern matching** and **control flow constructs**
* Other complex edge cases...

#### Example Syntax Ideas:

```text
Component HomePage:
  state user = fetchUser()
  render:
    if user is loading:
      show LoadingSpinner()
    else:
      show UserProfile(user)

Async Function fetchUser:
  await get('/api/user')
```

### 2. **Handling Complex Cases (Edge-Case Strategies)**
| ---------------------------------------------------- |

| Problem Mitigation Strategy Example                  |                                                                                               |                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Complex async flows                                  | Use `Async Function`, `await`, `try/catch`, `then`, `finally` keywords with structured syntax | `Async Function fetchUser: await get('/api/user')`                                        |
| Declarative UI with nested state                     | Use `Component`, `state`, `computed`, and `render:` blocks to guide structure                 | `Component HomePage: state user = fetchUser() render: ...`                                |
| Interop with other languages or tools                | Define clear `Bindings` blocks or `Import JS`, `Import Swift`                                 | `Import JS from './analytics.js' Bindings TrackEvent`                                     |
| Memory/resource management                           | Abstract with `allocate`, `defer`, or `release` blocks                                        | `allocate buffer = NewBuffer() defer release(buffer)`                                     |
| Database ops                                         | Use `Database Table`, `Query`, `Insert`, `Transaction` keywords with typed models             | `Database Table Users { id: Int, name: String } Insert Users(id: 1, name: "Alice")`       |
| Recursive tree/graph algorithms                      | Use `Function`, `Node`, and `recurse:` patterns                                               | `Function TraverseTree(node): if node: recurse TraverseTree(node.left)`                   |
| Cross-linked graph traversal with memory constraints | Leverage `visited` state tracking and explicit `allocate/release` of nodes                    | `Function CrawlGraph(start): state visited = Set() allocate queue = Queue() ...`          |
| Streaming I/O with transforms                        | Use `Stream`, `Transform`, and `Pipe` keywords                                                | `Stream input = ReadFile('data.csv') Transform clean = RemoveEmptyRows(input) Pipe clean` |
| Multi-threading or concurrency                       | Use `Parallel`, `Worker`, `Lock`, and `Shared` keywords to define isolation zones             | `Parallel Workers: Worker compress(files), Worker upload(files)`                          |
| Stateful UIs that react to DB changes                | Connect `state` blocks to `Query` results with `onChange:` handlers                           | `state users = Query AllUsers onChange: refresh UI`                                       |

Each of these examples offers a pathway toward capturing complex behaviors in a structured, human-readable form while maintaining the ability to translate efficiently into real-world languages like TypeScript, Swift, or Rust.

## Language Server and Extension Setup

### Dev Environment

* Use **VS Code** with built-in Language Server Protocol (LSP) support
* Language server written in **TypeScript** for fast development, easier debugging, and reusability
* Future optimization in Rust is possible if performance becomes a bottleneck (e.g. for memory-constrained LLM workflows)

### VS Code Extension Stack

* TypeScript
* Node.js runtime
* vscode-languageclient / vscode-languageserver packages

---

## VS Code File Organization Strategies

### Goals:

* Prevent clutter from pseudocode mirrors
* Enable seamless navigation between real and pseudocode
* Make the system feel elegant and scalable

### Option 1: Adjacent Files

```
src/
  App.tsx
  App.sudo
  api.ts
  api.sudo
```

**Pros:** Easy mapping and sync **Cons:** Clutters the file tree

### Option 2: Mirror Folder

```
src/
  App.tsx
  api.ts
.pseudo/
  src/
    App.sudo
    api.sudo
```

**Pros:** Keeps file tree clean, scalable **Cons:** Slightly more complex tooling

### Option 3: Embedded Pseudocode in Comments

```ts
// SUDO_START
// Describes a dynamic component with live data
// SUDO_END
function Widget() {...}
```

**Pros:** No new files, inline readability **Cons:** Pollutes source, fragile

### Option 4: Virtual Mode via Extension

* Toggling pseudocode mode hides all `.ts` files and shows `.sudo` or generated views
* Requires more extension logic but cleanest experience

### Suggested Combo:

Use **mirror folder** with optional **virtual toggle** to pseudocode-only view.

---

## Dev Tools and Commands

### File Management Enhancements

* `.vscode/settings.json` to hide pseudocode files:

```json
{
  "files.exclude": {
    "**/*.sudo": true
  }
}
```

### Extension UI Features

* Command Palette:

  * `Toggle Pseudocode View`
  * `Generate Pseudocode from Current File`
  * `Apply Pseudocode to Real Code`
* CodeLens buttons in headers:

  * `View/Edit Pseudocode`
* Diff View:

  * Visual diff between pseudocode and source

---

## Setup Instructions

### Project Bootstrap (TypeScript Extension)

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install --save-dev vscode vscode-languageclient typescript ts-node @types/node
```

2. Project Structure:

```
my-language-server/
  src/
    server.ts     # Language server entry
    pseudocode.ts # Parser + validator for pseudocode
    lsp.ts         # LSP bindings
  package.json
  tsconfig.json
  extension/
    src/
      extension.ts # VS Code client extension entry
```

3. Compile + Test:

```bash
npx tsc
code .
```

4. Debug inside VS Code with a launch config.

### No framework dependencies added by default â€” only core LSP tooling and minimal utilities.

## Conclusion

This document summarizes the initial roadmap for a robust pseudocode system with full IDE integration, clean file management, and strong edge-case handling for modern development. It combines structured design thinking with real-world tooling choices, optimized for clarity, speed, and future expandability.

Next steps could include scaffolding the language server, defining initial grammar tokens, and iterating on UI/UX for the extension.
